Remember to add that your block breaker jumping text - make it that anything you give that class will behave like that.

{
    move: "",
    hit_block: "",
    block_break: "",
    turn_from_hitting_block: "",
    win: "",
    top_three if players more than 3: "",
    lose: "",
}

If user did not click the window until game starts, the user will trigger waiting_music.
